    We have a "Candy Crush" board. We want to find out how many switches will "crush candies".<br />
    A "Candy Crush" board is a 2-dim list containing some elements.<br />
    A switch is switching two adjacent elements in board.<br />
    A switch "crushes candies" if there is at least three same elements in alignment after switching.

    Here is an example:
    <div style="font-family: monospace">
        [7,3,<span class="g1">1</span>,4,4]<br/>
        [7,3,<span class="g1">4</span>,3,2]<br/>
        [<span class="g1">3</span>,<span class="g1">7</span>,5,1,2]<br/>
        Result: <span class="g1">2</span>
    </div>
    After switching 3 and 7, we got three 7 and three 3 in alignment, so the switch "crushes candies".
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>
