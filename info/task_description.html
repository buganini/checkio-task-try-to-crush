    We have a Bejeweled style game board. We want to find out how many switches will clear cells.<br />
    A game board is a 2-dim list containing some elements.<br />
    A switch is switching two adjacent elements in board.<br />
    A switch clear cells if there is at least three adjacent cells contain same elements in alignment after switching.
    </i>
</p>
<p>
    Here is an example:
    <div style="font-family: monospace">
        [7,3,<span class="g1">1</span>,4,4]<br/>
        [7,3,<span class="g1">4</span>,3,2]<br/>
        [<span class="g1">3</span>,<span class="g1">7</span>,5,1,2]<br/>
        Result: <span class="g1">2</span>
    </div>
    After switching 3 and 7, we got three 7 and three 3 in alignment, so the switch clears cells.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong>
    2-dim list, the state of a game board. Different numbers mean different kinds of element, there are at most 5 kinds of elements
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong>
    Integer, how many switches can clear cells.
</p>

<div class="for_info_only">
    <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
    </p>
    <pre class="brush: python">
    assert checkio(
    [[2,1,3,2],
     [1,1,3,3],
     [2,2,1,3],
     [1,1,3,2],
     [3,2,3,2]]) == 7
    </pre>
</div>
